    - create UI workflow after worksheet validation
        v Add ability to move focus away from "Ready" button by pressing "up" arrow key
		. Allow focused "Ready" button to have separate style.
		v Focus 1st empty field after return to ws
		v results buttons : redo / other
        - clicking on question (but not in input box) should focus question & its input box
        - Results dialog: auto-focus "redo test" button. After clicking on the latter button, 
          auto-focus "start" button of Settings dialog.

	- "add/sub" module

	- enableWorksheet(false):
		. currently: input field is disabled. Make it read-only and don't allow cursor to appear.

    - var common:
        . keep???

    - create foreach function to loop over arrays and use it everywhere possible.

    - create a 'tools.map()' function that iterates over an array and applies a function to every element
        . if the array argument of 'map' is : tools.getAllElements(tools.elem("..."))
            then 'map' wil operate over an entire element tree.

    - Rename: tools.getAllElements --> tools.getAllChildren

    - add module : subtraction / addition
        . Move things like "focusQuestion()" to the module interface

    - Add item to browser history on state change
        . change URL on state change (URL parameters)

    - Worksheet validation: strike-through wrong answers 
      and put correct answer next to it in red

    - multi-language functionality

    - tools.js --> radi.js

    - Use layout scheme of dendron theme

	v Internationalisation:
		v create concept prj to test translation
		v implement in worsheetfw concept prj
		v add a mode that outputs necessary code in case of absent translation
            --> default behaviour. no mode.
		
    v in settings: "# questions" line of controls: disable initially, and enable when at least 1 table  chosen
        . re-disable when all tables de-selected

    v add enabling/disabling of element trees to app?/tools?
		See: concepts/disable' for functions that can give text spans and text labels
		a "disabled" look, by adding a 'disabled' class.
		
	v All tables checkbox: make it a button (to the right of checkboxes)

    v disabling a dialog: element with class "control": disable it AND all children too.

    v disabling an element: add a property with the previous value for re-enabling

    v add module : tables

    v close button : app.onCloseDialog("id...")
        v next state determined based on arg

    v app.enableDialog("id...")
        so no longer module-specific

    v validate ws

    v spin off worksheet logic into its own module
        v create mockup ws module with one input control in settings
            and a fixed number of questions in worksheet dialog.

    v enable dynamic loading/replacement of css files
        v test with an a.css/b.css combo, an onload function and a timeout

    v enable dynamic loading/replacement of js files
        v move over fsmGrid code to separate file and load it
            dynamically if needed
        v add dedicated function for replacing ws module

        x first make empty dialogs with:
            - (rounded corners)
            - close button where needed
            - dimmed background where needed
         --> no border-radius in IE8


================================================================================

Questions/Issues:
  - How to:
    . scroll page down from settings dialog to worksheet?
    . dim entire page except for 1 (modal) dialog?
    . draw rounded corners?
    . draw circular 'close' button at the top right corner?
    . custom-style controls (buttons, radiobuttons, checkboxes, input fields, ...)

Narrative
---------

Page loads:

- Main menu --> choose the type of test

Settings dialog
    At the bottom: "Start" button (initially disabled)
    At the upper right corner: 'x' to close the settings dialog (if the user clicks "yes" 
    in the ensuing warning dialog) and return to the main menu.
    When "Start" clicked, one of the following:

    - An error box below Settings dialog, reporting that no worksheet could be created with 
      the current settings. The user can keep working in the settings dialog, and then click "Start"
      again. (This awkward non-modal error box should never appear, validation of the fields in Settings dialog
      should enable the "Start" button only when ).

    - A warning box below Settings dialog (reporting that a worksheet could be created, but not
      all settings could be taken into account) and below it a worksheet. The settings dialog
      is disabled: it is still shown, but no further input is possible.

    - A worksheet. At the upper right corner a close button ('x') and at the bottom a "Ready"
      button. Settings dialog: disabled.
      The worksheet has a table-like layout, with every row representing an exercise. The exercises have
      3 parts (columns), left to right: 

          1. the question
          2. an edit box to fill out the answer
          3. some space to the right of the edit box to place a feedback icon.

      The feedback possibilities are:

          . "ok" (a green checkmark)
          . "wrong" (a red cross)
          . "empty field" (an exclamation mark in a triangle)

       -> When 'x' is clicked, and the user clicks "yes" in the ensuing warning dialog, the worksheet
          is closed and control returns to the settings dialog. 

       -> When 'Ready' is clicked:

            1. If not all fields are filled out, a warning dialog is shown below the worksheet and 
                the user can choose between "Continue anyway" or "Return to worksheet". Meanwhile, 
                in the feedback column, the empty fields are marked. If "Continue anyway" is 
                clicked, jump to step 3.
                
            2. If "Return to worksheet" is clicked, the warning dialog disappears and control returns
                to the worksheet. The "empty field" markers stay visible to guide the user in 
                finishing the worksheet. Focus is set on the uppermost empty field.
            
            3. If all fields are filled out, or if the user clicked "Continue anyway", the content of 
                the fields is validated, and an OK/X icon to the right of every field is displayed. 
                Fields that are still empty at this stage get 'X'.
                Below the worksheet a results dialog is shown with #good answers / total #answers.
                A button "redo test" allows the user to perform another test, by returning to the settings
				dialog.
                A button "other test" brings the user back to the main menu.
              


================================================================================

The buttons Settings->Start and Worksheet->Return should have an icon to the left resembling a 
(stylized) worksheet (with a pencil).

The buttons Worksheet->Ready and Worksheet->Continue should have a green checkmark to the left.
